m1 = Blog.create(name: "Github Branch", framework: "none", message: "Once I was trying to connect my github and epically failed. I needed to start connecting repos for my final portfolio and project in order to start working on the items for General Assembly. I had trouble connecting a local repo to my remote repo and went GoogleFoo search crazy. By the end of it I had a repo that was connected but not actually effecting the remote nor was the local repo taking anything down from the remote to itself. My action at that point was to ask for another set of eyes for help. When the TA Office hours opened I asked for assistance. Github is moving away from using the term 'Master' and trying to convert to 'Main.' For whatever reason my repo would connect to the Master and kept having issues connecting to the main. At one point in time I had typed and sweated the issue with the TA so much I had accidentally created a branch called, just that 'Branch.' In conclusion I learned that following the Github directions are important and should not be rushed. GoogleFooing is nice but slowing down or starting over is sometimes a better solution. It's a good thing both the TA and I were in good humor by the time we had discover my branch named 'Branch' and I created a brand new repo and started over so I didn't have to look back at the history but keep moving forward with my projects.
